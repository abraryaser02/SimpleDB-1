We decided to use ArrayLists for the TupleDesc and Tuple classes, in order to provide easy insertion and
and deletion. Our BufferPool class is implemented using a Concurrent Hash Map, which allows for thread safety
compared to a normal hash map. When removing and adding to the bufferpool, this will guarantee that the number of
records stored in it will always be an accurate number, and the hashmasp allows for constant lookup.
