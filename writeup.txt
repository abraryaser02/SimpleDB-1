We decided to use ArrayLists for the TupleDesc and Tuple classes, in order to provide easy insertion and
and deletion. 

Our BufferPool class is implemented using a Concurrent Hash Map, which allows for thread safety
compared to a normal hash map. When removing and adding to the bufferpool, this will guarantee that the number of
records stored in it will always be an accurate number, and the hashmap allows for constant lookup.

For several of the unique names of id, such as the getId() function in HeapPageId, we used the built in function
.getHashCode() for a simple way to generate unique ids and hashes. 

We spent around 8 hours doing the lab. The most confusing part of the lab was implementing the iterator for the
HeapFile, but most of the functions were relatively straigthforward. When getting starting, it also took a little
bit of time to  fully understanding all of the classes and the way they interacted with each other, but working
through each part made it more clear.
